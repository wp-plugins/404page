== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are 404 errors redirected? =

No, there is no redirection! The chosen page is delivered as a 'real' 404 error page. This results in a HTTP 404 code and not in 301 or 302, which is important for Search Engines to tell them, that the page does not exist and should be deleted from the index.
